# Employee Turnover Analysis Using IBM HR Analytics Data
## Motivation
The purpose of this project is to explore factors that influence employee turnover using the publicly available IBM HR Analytics dataset from Kaggle. This analysis aims to identify key predictors of employee attrition and suggest actionable insights for organizations to enhance employee retention.
## Libraries Used
'pandas' <br /> for data manipulation and analysis.

'numpy' <br /> for numerical operations.

'sklearn' <br /> for machine learning and predictive modeling.

'matplotlib' <br /> and seaborn for data visualization.

'imblearn' <br /> for handling class imbalance with SMOTE.
## Files in the Repository
Udacity-Project.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and detailed analysis. <br />
HR-Employee-Attrition.csv: The dataset used in the analysis, sourced from Kaggle. <br />

Requirements.txt: the libraries, you can install the librarries by running this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Summary of Results
The analysis revealed several key insights into employee turnover:

**Commute Distance**: Employees with longer commutes have slightly higher attrition rates, suggesting that flexible work arrangements might be beneficial.

**Career Progression**: There is a strong positive correlation between career advancement and employee retention, highlighting the importance of clear career paths.


**Key Factors of Turnover**: Factors such as job satisfaction, monthly income, and years since the last promotion were significant predictors of attrition. Addressing these can help reduce turnover rates.
